# Support Ticket Processing System

This project outlines a structured system for managing support tickets efficiently. The system leverages four agents: one manager (Supervisor) and three specialist agents (Classifier, Router, Responder). Each agent performs specific tasks in a sequential workflow to process and respond to tickets effectively.

## **Building Steps**
1. **Setup the Environment:**
   - Install necessary dependencies.
   - Configure API keys or credentials if external services are used.

2. **Define Agent Functionalities:**
   - Implement individual methods for each agent as described in the architecture.

3. **Integrate Agents into a Workflow:**
   - Define the Supervisor agent to manage coordination.
   - Link the Classifier, Router, and Responder agents into the workflow.

4. **Test the System:**
   - Use sample tickets to validate the functionality of each agent.
   - Ensure smooth handoffs and proper error handling.

5. **Deploy:**
   - Host the application on a cloud platform or on-premise infrastructure.
   - Monitor logs and optimize the workflow as needed.

## **Overall System Architecture**

### Workflow
- A sequential ticket-processing workflow where tickets flow through four agents:

  1. **Input Ticket** → Supervisor Agent.
  2. Supervisor → Classifier Agent (to determine category and priority).
  3. Supervisor → Router Agent (to decide the best department).
  4. Supervisor → Responder Agent (to draft an initial response).
  5. Supervisor reviews and outputs the final result.

### Agent Definitions

#### **Supervisor Agent**
- **Role:** Coordinates the workflow among agents.
- **Skills:** Process management, delegation, quality control.
- **Tools Needed:**
  - Access to all ticket information.
  - Ability to call other agents.

#### **Classifier Agent**
- **Role:** Performs initial ticket analysis.
- **Skills:** Categorization, priority assessment, key information extraction.
- **Tools Needed:**
  - Classification prompt templates.
  - Category definitions.
- **Outputs:**
  - Ticket category.
  - Priority level.
  - Key extracted information.

##### **Methods:**
- `analyze_ticket_content()`: Extracts key information from ticket text.
- `determine_priority()`: Assigns priority based on content.
- `identify_category()`: Maps ticket to predefined categories.

#### **Router Agent**
- **Role:** Determines the best department or handler for the ticket.
- **Skills:** Department matching, workload assessment.
- **Tools Needed:**
  - Department rules/criteria.
  - Current workload information.
- **Outputs:**
  - Target department.
  - Routing justification.

##### **Methods:**
- `check_department_load()`: Checks current ticket load per department.
- `match_skills_required()`: Maps ticket needs to department capabilities.
- `get_routing_rules()`: Retrieves current routing policies.

#### **Responder Agent**
- **Role:** Drafts initial responses to tickets.
- **Skills:** Response composition, template customization.
- **Tools Needed:**
  - Response templates.
  - Knowledge base access.
- **Outputs:**
  - Draft response.
  - Suggested knowledge base articles.

##### **Methods:**
- `fetch_knowledge_base_articles()`: Gets relevant help articles.
- `generate_response()`: Creates a custom response.
- `check_response_tone()`: Ensures the response tone is appropriate.

## **Agent Implementation Example**
Assign tools to agents using the following structure:

```python
classifier_agent = Agent(
    role="Classifier",
    goal="Accurately categorize support tickets",
    tools=[
        analyze_ticket_content, 
        determine_priority, 
        identify_category
    ]
)

router_agent = Agent(
    role="Router",
    goal="Assign tickets to the best department",
    tools=[
        check_department_load, 
        match_skills_required, 
        get_routing_rules
    ]
)

responder_agent = Agent(
    role="Responder",
    goal="Draft effective initial responses",
    tools=[
        fetch_knowledge_base_articles, 
        generate_response, 
        check_response_tone
    ]
)

supervisor_agent = Agent(
    role="Supervisor",
    goal="Coordinate the ticket processing workflow",
    tools=[classifier_agent, router_agent, responder_agent]
)
```

## **Future Enhancements**
- **Machine Learning Integration:**
  - Train models for ticket classification and routing.
  - Use NLP for response generation.

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Add logging and analytics to monitor the system.

- **Scalability:**
  - Adapt the system for high volumes of tickets.

- **Feedback Loops:**
  - Incorporate customer feedback to improve the response quality.
